# Extract Metadata

An Omeka S module for that allows site administrators to extract embedded metadata from media files, such as photograph metadata embedded when a digital camera takes a picture. 

The module can manually extract embedded metadata found on individual files, and adds batch-editing features. When enabled, it automatically works on newly uploaded files, and can work on bulk imports. The extracted metadata can be copied onto Omeka S item and media properties with mapping configuration.

Extractors include EXIF metadata (commonly found on JPEG and TIFF files), Tika (commonly found on PDFs, PPTs, etc.), ID3 (commonly found on MP3s), etc. For more information, see the manual.
